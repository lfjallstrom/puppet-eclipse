eclipse

This class installs eclipse and some useful components.

Here is an example of how use this code in our own manifests:

	# install eclipse indigo and the plugins we use in our own deployments (working in debian squeeze)
	eclipse::package::phpdelux{"eclipseplusplugins":}
	
	# Import project
	eclipse::project::phpsvn{"eclipsephpandsvnproject":
      projectname=>[project name],
      workspacepath=>[path to workspace],
      path=>[path to project folder],
      group=>[group ownership of folder],
      owner=>[user ownership of folder],
      mode=>[file permissions of folder],
      require=>Eclipse::Package::Phpdelux["eclipseplusplugins"]
    }
	    
	# Fix any issues that happen with the workspace
	eclipse::fixworkspace{"eclipsefixworkspace":
	    workspacepath=>[path to work space],
	    owner=>[user ownership of folder],
	    group=>[group ownership of folder],
	    mode=>[file permissions of folder],
      	require=>Eclipse::Project::Phpsvn["eclipsephpandsvnproject"]
 	}
